Skills
*Python scripting
*Pandas
*Data Visualization
*Machine Learning
Domain
*Data Analysis and Machine Learning
Problem Statement
*The project aims to predict the likelihood of people taking an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.
*It involves analyzing a dataset containing various features related to individuals' behaviors, perceptions, and demographics and building a predictive model to determine vaccine acceptance.
*The goal is to target vaccination campaigns more effectively based on predicted probabilities.

Approach
Data Collection:

Access the dataset from the provided URL.
Data Engineering:

*Understand and engineer the dataset as needed.
*Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
*Handle missing values and categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
*Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features.
*Visualize relationships between variables using charts and graphs.
*Identify patterns and trends in the data.

Dashboard Development:
*Develop an analytical dashboard with dynamic charts and data filtering options.
*Use Plotly or Streamlit for interactive visualization.
*Include at least 5 types of dynamic charts and 3 data filtering options.

Model Development:
*Train a Logistic Regression model (or any suitable model) for prediction.
*Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
*Tune hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

Model Serving API and Application Development:
*Develop a predictive model serving API using Flask.
*Create an application for end-users to input features and receive predictions.
*Use Plotly, Streamlit, or Flask for application development.

Hosting:
Host the application using free hosting services like Render or PythonAnywhere.
Ensure the application is accessible to end-users.

Dataset Information
The dataset contains various features related to individuals' behaviors, perceptions, and demographics.
Features include worry about H1N1 flu, awareness, medication, contact avoidance, mask purchase, hand hygiene, etc.
The target variable is whether the respondent received the H1N1 vaccine or not.
